Augmented.js Presentation SASS/CSS Module Dark Mode


# What this is
Augmented.js Presentation CSS is a custom implementation of Google's Material Design. See [Material Design](https://material.io). The difference from other libraries is the idea it could be used everywhere regardless of framework.  Also, the animations are *pure* css vs javascript, so some things will not be 100% but more performant with less footprint.
